--- Description ---

I've included some low poly desktop PCs, retro and modern consoles directly based off real counterparts, gaming chairs with different variantions in a modular way, furniture, TVs/Monitors as well as some streaming related furniture, lighting and deco furniture. Original textures included (for each type of game disk/cartridge, deco, etc) as well as some starting palettes.

You may find some important things missing, in which case I encourage you to tell me on my itch.io page, so I can update the set with more models!

*Make sure to snap things to the grid when using tiles*

*Look at my itch.io page for details*
